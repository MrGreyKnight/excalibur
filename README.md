## CLI Interface

Provide source & output directories

Recursively search through files in source dircetory and sort into new directory layout.

The layout will match the following:

```
-- Month
---- Day
------ CameraType
```

camera type will use an internal lookup to match the camera brand with their raw filetype. If a match is not found it will use the filetype for the directory name.

## GUI

to be added later.
